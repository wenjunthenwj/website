# Teaching Inspirations

I really like quote "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants" by Sir Isaac Newton. This page is where I honor and credit the many people and content creators that have inspired me and my teaching style.

## <b> 3Blue1Brown </b>

His videos and animations were such a lifesaver when I was a university student struggling linear algebra and differential equations. The main thing that stuck out were how professional his animations looked and how his videos approached math. Instead of approaching it as set of theorems that needed to be explained, it was more of a 'hey lets explore and think about it together' kind of vibe. Thanks to him making the manim library public, I eventually learnt how to use it to create an [animation](https://youtu.be/CxecbZ5B1w8) of my own for one of my modules. Here's a TED talk that he gave on his philosophy behind creating math videos, its really amazing:

## <b> Mythbusters </b>

Mythbusters were my childhood heroes that made learning science cool and entertaining. From explosions to really bizzare ideas, watching them build and test out an idea from scratch was what led me to be interested in engineering. Their personalities really shined through and I think Adam Savage is one of the smartest, eccentric and fun loving person that appeared on TV which made him such a great host. Despite not becoming an engineer, I think that Mythbusters really showed that a little bit of curiousity and craziness can bring out the joy in learning.

## <b> Mike Boyd </b>

Mike is a YouTuber who documents his process of learning new skills in short amounts of time. Watching his videos reinforces the idea that any skill can be learnt - you just need the correct learning technique and to put in the effort. From learning to do a kickflip to counting cards in Blackjack, he's truly done it all. One of my favourite videos is where he tries to sit for the Oxford's Maths Admissions Test and tries to improve his score as much as possible with just one day of cramming/studying (accompanied by one of the coolest professors).

## <b> Vsauce </b>

It's really tough to describe the genre of Vsauce's content, but for me it has always been a channel that asks questions that sparks curiousity. Their videos are from all sorts of topics, from psychology to discussing time travel, and I always found it so cool that they were able to make it SO INTERESTING, even for the average person who may not be interested in that kinda stuff. That's what makes him such a great 'teacher', one that sparks curiousity in his viewers and explains stuff in a way that makes you engaged.

## <b> Teachers who have taught me </b>

I would have been nothing without the support of all the teachers in my life who really made an impact on me. From Primary School all the way to University, there are too many teachers that I have the utmost thanks and respect for. I would like to extend special thanks to my final year project supervisor [Prof. Daniel Sng](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/sng-wei-meng-daniel/) as well as [Prof. Aaron Tan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/tantc/), [Prof. Alan Cheng](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/hcheng/), and [Prof. Kan Min Yen](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/kanmy/) for being such amazing professors from the NUS computing department.
