# Teaching Inspirations

I really like quote "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants" by Sir Isaac Newton. This page is where I honor and credit the many people and content creators that have inspired me and my teaching style.

## <b> 3Blue1Brown </b>

His videos and animations were such a lifesaver when I was a university student struggling linear algebra and differential equations. The main thing that stuck out were how professional his animations looked and how his videos approached math. Instead of approaching it as set of theorems that needed to be explained, it was more of a 'hey lets explore and think about it together' kind of vibe. Thanks to him making the manim library public, I eventually learnt how to use it to create an [animation](https://youtu.be/CxecbZ5B1w8) of my own for one of my modules. Here's a TED talk that he gave on his philosophy behind creating math videos, its really amazing:

## <b> Mythbusters </b>

Mythbusters were my childhood heroes that made learning science cool and entertaining. From explosions to really bizzare ideas, watching them build and test out an idea from scratch was what led me to be interested in engineering. Their personalities really shined through and I think Adam Savage is one of the smartest, eccentric and fun loving person that appeared on TV which made him such a great host. Despite not becoming an engineer, I think that Mythbusters really showed that a little bit of curiousity and craziness can bring out the joy in learning.
