# Math Genius coin

I really wanted a physical object that represents me that I can give as a gift, sort of like a namecard - but cooler. I took inspiration from the [MCC coin](https://twitter.com/MCChampionship_/status/1251631949975826433) and came up with the concept art my own with the help of a friend. With the help of some of my engineer friends in university, we came up with a CAD model and went ahead to 3D print a batch of them.

All of the features of the coin represent interests and things that I find cool in the domain of math. The far left shows a neural network, which is my passion for AI and machine learning. The centre shows a hypercube (4-D cube) and it signifies my interest for discrete math, which is one of the most interesting yet difficult courses I took in university. On the far right, it shows a calculus symbols, which is probably my favourite topic to teach in the high school math syllabus.
