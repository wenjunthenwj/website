# Math Genius coin

I really wanted a physical object that represents me that I can give as a gift, sort of like a namecard - but cooler. I took inspiration from the [MCC coin](https://twitter.com/MCChampionship_/status/1251631949975826433) and came up with the concept art my own with the help of a friend.

All of the features of the coin represent interests and things that I find cool in the domain of math. The far left shows a neural network, which is my passion for AI and machine learning. The centre shows a hypercube (4-D cube) and it signifies my interest for discrete math, which is one of the most interesting yet difficult courses I took in university. On the far right, it shows a calculus symbols, which is probably my favourite topic to teach in the high school math syllabus.

I usually hand out these coins at the end of the year to the top few students of each class and ocassionally as a token of appreciation. I originally wanted the coins to be made of metal, but that turned out to be WAYYYY too expensive due to it needing to be stamped or CNC milled. With the help of one of my good friends in university, we came up with a CAD model and went ahead to 3D print my first batch of ~150 coins.
