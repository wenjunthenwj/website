# Rules and Achievements

## <b> Collecting stars </b>

Wen Jun uses a small-scale gamification system in his classes for extra study motivation. Homework assignments must be handed up on time and are graded on a 1 star(:star:), 2 star(:star::star:) or 3 star(:star::star::star:) completion. The total number of stars will be tallied up over the year and the top 3 students will recieve a Math Genius Coin and maybe some other reward as well at the end of the year.

## <b> Unlocking achievements </b>

Other than completing homework problems, students can earn stars by unlocking achievements as well. Each achievement can only be unlocked once and will be reflected on the leaderboard. Achievements are split up into Easy, Medium and Hard and are worth 1,3,5 stars each respectively.
